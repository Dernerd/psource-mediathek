# Intro
psmt-pure.css is a modified version of pure.css from purecss.io

Instead of using pure-classname, please use psmt-classname. e.g pure-g should be written as psmt-g for the row

## There is one major change though. Since WordPress auto adds 'page-numbers' class to the paginated links. We have updated pure-paginator and made it to use wrapped div element instead.
